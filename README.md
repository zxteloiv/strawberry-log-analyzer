# strawberry-log-analyzer
A data analyzer based on aggregation.

This is the final probject for my bachelor school years ago. I found these codes may be useful recently, then I push it here.

It is built on Visual Studio 2008 ever, and it would run on any Windows operating system later than Windows XP.

The database is SQLServer 2008. And it needs some modification on the CreateDB.sql file if the deployed db is another.
