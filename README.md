# strawberry-log-analyzer
A data analyzer based on aggregation.

This is the final probject for my bachelor school years ago. I found these codes may be useful recently, then I push it here.

It is build on Visual Studio 2008 ever, and it would run on any Windows operating system later than Windows XP.
